OONI: Open Observatory of Network Interference
==============================================

The Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI) is a global observation
network which collects high quality data, using open methodologies and Free and Open Source Software (FL/OSS), to share observations about the various types, methods, and amounts of network tampering in the world.


    "The Net interprets censorship as damage and routes around it."
                - John Gilmore; TIME magazine (6 December 1993)

Are you interested in testing your network for signs of surveillance and censorship? Do you want to collect data so that you and others can better understand your network? If so, please read this document and we hope that ooniprobe will help you gather network data that will assist you with your endeavors!

ooniprobe
---------

ooniprobe is a program that users can run to probe their network and to collect network measurement data. ooniprobe also allows users to choose what test should be run and what backend should be used for storing the test report and for assisting them in running the test.

ooniprobe tests are divided into two categories: **Traffic Manipulation** and
**Content Blocking**.

**Traffic Manipulation** tests aim to detect the presence of some sort of
tampering with the internet traffic between the probe and a remote test helper
backend. As such they usually require the selection of a oonib backend
component for running the test.

**Content Blocking** tests aim to enumerate the kind of content that is
blocked from the probes network point of view. As such they usually require the specification of an input list for running the test.

Read this before running ooniprobe!
-----------------------------------

Running ooniprobe can potentially be a risky activity. This largely depends on the laws and jurisdiction of the country you are running ooniprobe from, as well as on the type of test you are running. Technically, it is possible for a person observing your internet connection to be aware of the fact that you are running ooniprobe. This means that if running network measurement tests is something that is considered to be illegal in your country then you could be spotted.

Furthermore, ooniprobe takes no precautions to protect the install target machine from forensics analysis.  If the fact that you have installed or used ooniprobe is a liability for you, please be aware of this risk.

Using ooniprobe
===============

**Net test** is a set of measurements to assess what kind of internet censorship is occurring.

**Decks** are collections of ooniprobe nettests with some associated inputs.

**Collector** is a service used to report the results of measurements.

**Test helper** is a service used by a probe for successfully performing its measurements.

**Bouncer** is a service used to discover the addresses of test helpers and collectors.

OONI in 5 minutes
=================

On debian testing or unstable::

    sudo apt-get install ooniprobe

If you are running debian stable you can get it from backports via::

    sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://http.debian.net/debian wheezy-backports main" >> /etc/apt/sources.list'
    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install ooniprobe

On unix systems::

    sudo pip install ooniprobe

To install it from the current master run::

    sudo pip install https://github.com/TheTorProject/ooni-probe/archive/master.zip

Then run::

    mkdir my_decks
    sudo ooniresources --update-inputs --update-geoip
    oonideckgen -o my_decks/

**BUG** Note:
ooniprobe version 1.2.2 when installed from the debian repository will not
properly create the ooni home folder and if you run into an error in accessing
`~/.ooni/` run::

    ooniprobe -n blocking/http_requests -u http://google.com/

This should generate the home and allow you to run oonideckgen.

The output from the last command will tell you how to run ooniprobe to perform
the measurement.

If you would like to contribute measurements to OONI daily you can also add this to your crontab::

    @daily ooniprobe $THE_OONI_COMMAND

Run this command to automatically update your crontab:: 

      (crontab -l 2>/dev/null; echo "@daily ooniprobe $THE_OONI_COMMAND") | crontab -

Installation
============

Debian based systems
--------------------

If you are running Debian testing or Debian unstable you can install ooniprobe
simply with::
    
    apt-get install ooniprobe

If you are running Debian stable you can get it from backports via::

    sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://http.debian.net/debian wheezy-backports main" >> /etc/apt/sources.list'
    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install ooniprobe

If you are running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS you can install it from the PPA
(https://launchpad.net/~irl/+archive/ubuntu/ooni/)::

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:irl/ooni
    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install ooniprobe

You will be warned that the packages are unauthenticated. This is due to the
PPA not being signed and is normal behaviour. If you would prefer to verify the
integrity of the package, use our private Debian repository below.

Mac OS X
--------

You can install ooniprobe on OSX if you have installed homebrew (http://mxcl.github.io/homebrew) with::

    brew install ooniprobe

Unix systems (with pip)
-----------------------

Make sure you have installed the following depedencies:

  * build-essential
  * python (>=2.7)
  * python-dev
  * pip
  * libgeoip-dev
  * libdumbnet-dev
  * libpcap-dev
  * libssl-dev
  * libffi-dev
  * tor (>=0.2.5.1 to run all the tor related tests)

Then you should be able to install ooniprobe by running::

    sudo pip install ooniprobe

Configuring ooniprobe
---------------------

You may edit the configuration for ooniprobe by editing the configuration file
found inside of ``~/.ooni/ooniprobe.conf``.

By default ooniprobe will not include personal identifying information in the
test result, nor create a pcap file. This behavior can be personalized.


Updating resources
------------------

To generate decks you will have to update the input resources of ooniprobe.

This can be done with::

    ooniresources --update-inputs

If you get a permission error, you might have to run the command as root or
change the ooniprobe data directory inside of `ooniprobe.conf`.

On some platforms, such as debian contrib, you will not get all the geoip
related files needed. In that case it is possible to manually download them
with ``ooniresources``::

    ooniresources --update-geoip

Generating decks
----------------

You can generate decks for your country with the oonideckgen command.

If you wish, for example, to generate a deck to be run in the country of Italy,
you can do so (be sure to have updated the input resources first) by running::

    oonideckgen --country-code IT --output ~/

You will now have in your home a folder called `deck-it`, containing the ooni
deck (ends with .deck) and the inputs.

**Note:** You should not move the `deck-*` directory once it has been
generated as the paths to the inputs referenced by the test in the deck are
absolute. If you want your deck to live in another directory you must
regenerated it.


Running decks
-------------

You will find all the installed decks inside of ``/usr/share/ooni/decks``.

You may then run a deck by using the command line option ``-i``:

As root::

    ooniprobe -i /usr/share/ooni/decks/mlab.deck


Or as a user::

    ooniprobe -i /usr/share/ooni/decks/mlab_no_root.deck


Or:

As root::

    ooniprobe -i /usr/share/ooni/decks/complete.deck


Or as a user::

    ooniprobe -i /usr/share/ooni/decks/complete_no_root.deck


The above tests will require around 20-30 minutes to complete depending on your network speed.

If you would prefer to run some faster tests you should run:
As root::

    ooniprobe -i /usr/share/ooni/decks/fast.deck


Or as a user::

    ooniprobe -i /usr/share/ooni/decks/fast_no_root.deck


Running net tests
-----------------

You may list all the installed stable net tests with::


    ooniprobe -s


You may then run a nettest by specifying its name for example::


    ooniprobe manipulation/http_header_field_manipulation


It is also possible to specify inputs to tests as URLs::


    ooniprobe blocking/http_requests -f httpo://ihiderha53f36lsd.onion/input/37e60e13536f6afe47a830bfb6b371b5cf65da66d7ad65137344679b24fdccd1


You can find the result of the test in your current working directory.

By default the report result will be collected by the default ooni collector
and the addresses of test helpers will be obtained from the default bouncer.

You may also specify your own collector or bouncer with the options ``-c`` and
``-b``.


Bridges and obfsproxy bridges
=============================

ooniprobe submits reports to oonib report collectors through Tor to a hidden
service endpoint. By default, ooniprobe uses the installed system Tor, but can
also be configured to launch Tor (see the advanced.start_tor option in
ooniprobe.conf), and ooniprobe supports bridges (and obfsproxy bridges, if
obfsproxy is installed). The tor.bridges option in ooniprobe.conf sets the path
to a file that should contain a set of "bridge" lines (of the same format as
used in torrc, and as returned by https://bridges.torproject.org). If obfsproxy
bridges are to be used, the path to the obfsproxy binary must be configured.

See option advanced.obfsproxy_binary, in ooniprobe.conf.

(Optional) Install obfsproxy
----------------------------

Install the latest version of obfsproxy for your platform.

Download Obfsproxy: https://www.torproject.org/projects/obfsproxy.html.en

Setting capabilities on your virtualenv python binary
=====================================================

If your distributation supports capabilities you can avoid needing to run OONI as root::


    setcap cap_net_admin,cap_net_raw+eip /path/to/your/virtualenv's/python


Reporting bugs
==============

You can report bugs and issues you find with ooni-probe on The Tor Projec issue
tracker filing them under the "Ooni" component: https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/newticket?component=Ooni.

You can either register an account or use the group account "cypherpunks" with
password "writecode".

and `Traffic Manipulation tests
<https://gitweb.torproject.org/ooni-probe.git/tree/HEAD:/ooni/nettests/blocking>`_
can be found in the nettests/blocking and nettests/manipulation directories
respectively.

Content Blocking Tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    <https://gitweb.torproject.org/ooni-probe.git/tree/HEAD:/ooni/nettests/third_party>`_

ooni-backend
------------

This is the server side component of ooniprobe. It will store data
collected from ooniprobes and it will run a series of Test Helpers that assist
`Traffic Manipulation Tests`_ in performing their measurements.

Test Helpers
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The currently implemented test helpers are the following:

  * `SSL Test Helpers
    <https://gitweb.torproject.org/oonib.git/blob/HEAD:/oonib/testhelpers/ssl_helpers.py>`_

  * `HTTP Test Helpers
    <https://gitweb.torproject.org/oonib.git/blob/HEAD:/oonib/testhelpers/http_helpers.py>`_

  * `TCP Test Helpers
    <https://gitweb.torproject.org/oonib.git/blob/HEAD:/oonib/testhelpers/tcp_helpers.py>`_

  * `DNS Test Helpers
    <https://gitweb.torproject.org/oonib.git/blob/HEAD:/oonib/testhelpers/dns_helpers.py>`_

Threat Model
------------

Our adversary is capable of doing country wide network surveillance and 
manipulation of network traffic.

The goals of our adversary are to:

  * Restrict access to certain content, while not degrading overall quality of 
    the network
  * Monitor the network in a way that they are able to identify misuse of it in
    real time

More specifc to the running of network filtering detection tests:

1. Detect actors performing censorship detection tests
2. Fool people running such tests into believing that the network is 
   unrestricted

**Note:** While 2) => 1) it is not true that 1) => 2) as the identification of 
such actors does not necessarily have to happen in real time.

While our intention is to minimize the risk of users running OONI probe being 
identified, this comes with a trade-off in accuracy. It is therefore necessary in 
certain tests to trade-off fingerprintability in favour of test accuracy.

This is why we divide tests based on what risk the users running them can face, 
allowing users to freely choose what threat model they wish to adere to.
