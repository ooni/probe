Details
=======

*Test Name*: Psiphon

*Current version*: 0.1

*NetTest*: Psiphon (https://github.com/TheTorProject/ooni-probe/blob/master/ooni/nettests/third_party/psiphon.py)

*Test Helper*: None

*Test Type*: third party

*Requires Root*: No

Description
===========

This test first check that the Psiphon path exists, then launches Psiphon and
parses output to determine if it has bootstrapped. After bootstrap, it fetches
`http://www.google.com/humans.txt` using Psiphons SOCKS
proxy listening on 127.0.0.1:1080 (or otherwise specified by the --socksproxy
argument).
It will then check to see if the response body contains the string: "Google is built by a large"

The specific string used to determine bootstrap from Psiphon output in version
"0.0.1" is "Press Ctrl-C to terminate." from standard output.

How to run the test
===================

`ooniprobe third_party/psiphon`

To test Psiphon when it is installed in a different path other than the user home:

`ooniprobe third_party/psiphon -p <path to Psiphon repository>`

For advanced usages you may also configure a different URL and expected body
for the response with the `--url` and `--expected-body` command line options.

`ooniprobe third_party/psiphon --url http://www.github.com/humans.txt --expected-body '/* TEAM */'`


How to install Psiphon
===================

Run the install script:

`scripts/psiphon_install.sh`

To run Psiphon manually, it must be run inside of the proper directory:

`cd <psiphonpath>//psiphon-circumvention-system/pyclient/`
`python psi_client.py`

Sample report
=============
