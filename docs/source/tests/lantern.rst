Details
=======

*Test Name*: Lantern

*Current version*: 0.0.1

*NetTest*: Name (https://github.com/TheTorProject/ooni-probe/blob/master/ooni/nettests/third_party/lantern.py)

*Test Helper*: None

*Test Type*: Third Party

*Requires Root*: No

Description
===========

This test launches Lantern in --headless mode, and parses output to determine
if it has bootstrapped.  After bootstrap, it fetches a URL using Lanterns HTTP
proxy interface listening on 127.0.0.1.8787 and checks to see if the response
body matches the expected result.
As a URL for testing we use http://www.google.com/humans.txt and look for the
string "Google is built by a large" in the response body.

The specific string used to determine bootstrap from Lantern output in version
"2.0.10" is "Successfully dialed via" from standard output.

How to run the test
===================

`ooniprobe nettests/third_party/lantern.py`

For advanced usages you may also configure a different URL and expected body
for the response with the `--url` and `--expected-body` command line options.

`ooniprobe nettests/third_party/lantern.py --url http://humanstxt.org/humans.txt --expected-body '/* TEAM */'`

Sample report
=============
