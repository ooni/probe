This is a list of things to be done on ooni-probe.

Once you have completed something you should add a
note to this file stating what you have done under
the item.

Migrate code from old
---------------------

Migrate all the interesting parts of the old code to the new.

It's important to make the new code asych and based on gevent.
It should respect the design goals of the new ooni-probe model.

* All the parts related to HTTP and Squid (old/ooni/http.py)
effort: low, skill: medium

* Misc scripts to detect censorship that are not written in any
  version of OONI (old/ooni/plugins/old_stuff_to_convert/)
effort: low-medium, skill: low-medium

New things to develop
---------------------

These are either components specific to the new refactor of ooni
or that we haven't yet figured out how they should work.

* Design and implement the Worker and the Unit of Work classes

* Design and implement the Node Factory

* Design and implement the Network Node and the Code Exec node classes

New things to test
------------------

Please check that the submodules are working correctly. From ../ooni-probe/,
do:

$ git submodules init && git submodules update

Make sure that they clone correctly, and run a few ooni tests to make sure
the import statements haven't broken.

Write unittests for *all of the things*. Can anyone suggest a good framework?
