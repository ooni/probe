v1.1.0 (Tue, 19 Aug 2014)
-------------------------

In this new release of ooniprobe we have added a new command line tool for
listing the reports that have not been published to a collector and that allows
the probe operator to choose which ones they would like to upload.

We have also made some privacy improvements to the reports (we will sanitize
all things that may look like file paths) and added metadata associated with
the maxmind database being used by the probe operator.

Here is a more detailed list of what has been done:

* Annotate on disk which reports we have submitted and which ones we have not:
  https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/11860

* Add tool called oonireport for publishing unpublished ooniprobe reports to a
  collector: https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/11862

* Probe Report does not leak filepaths anymore:
  https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/12706

* Reports now include version information about the maxmind database being
  used: https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/12771

* We now do integrity checks on the ooniprobe.conf file so that we don't start
  the tool if the config file is missing some settings or is not consistent:
  https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/11983
  (thanks to Alejandro López (kudrom))

* Improvements have been made to the sniffer subsystem (thanks to Alejandro
  López (kudrom))

  says it will be:
