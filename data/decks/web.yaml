tries to detect censorship and/or surveillance systems in your network. The Web
Connectivity test examines whether access to websites is blocked through DNS
tampering, TCP/IP blocking, or by a transparent HTTP proxy. The
HTTP Header Field Manipulation test tries to detect censorship and/or
surveillance systems in your network by sending HTTP headers to an echo server
that have variations in capitalization."
