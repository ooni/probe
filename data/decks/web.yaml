The Web Connectivity test examines whether access to websites is blocked through DNS tampering, TCP connection RST/IP blocking, or by a transparent HTTP proxy. The HTTP Header Field Manipulation test tries to detect censorship and/or surveillance systems in your network by sending HTTP headers to an echo server that have variations in capitalization."
