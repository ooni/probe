.SH OONIPROBE
.SS Read this before running ooniprobe!
.sp
Running ooniprobe is a potentially risky activity. This greatly depends on the
jurisdiction in which you are in and which test you are running. It is
technically possible for a person observing your internet connection to be
aware of the fact that you are running ooniprobe. This means that if running
network measurement tests is something considered to be illegal in your country
then you could be spotted.
.sp
Furthermore, ooniprobe takes no precautions to protect the install target machine
from forensics analysis.  If the fact that you have installed or used ooni
probe is a liability for you, please be aware of this risk.
.SS What is this?
.sp
ooniprobe is the command line tool that volunteers and researches interested in
contributing data to the project should be running.
.sp
If you are interested in using ooniprobe from a graphical user interface
refer to \fBooniprobe\-agent\fP and see how to run that.
.sp
ooniprobe allows the user to select what test should be run and what backend
should be used for storing the test report and/or assisting them in the running
of the test.
.sp
ooniprobe tests are divided into two categories: \fBTraffic Manipulation\fP and
\fBContent Blocking\fP\&.
.sp
\fBTraffic Manipulation\fP tests aim to detect the presence of some sort of
tampering with the internet traffic between the probe and a remote test helper
backend. As such they usually require the selection of a oonib backend
component for running the test.
.sp
\fBContent Blocking\fP are aimed at enumerating the kind of content that is
blocked from the probes network point of view. As such they usually require to
have specified an input list for running the test.
