If it has not been created, because the user specified to not use a
collector.

the collector does not accept our report or because it was unreachable at the
time.

If the report has been successfully created, but has not yet been
closed.

.SH OONIREPORT
.sp
This tool is used to upload reports that are stored on the users
filesystem and have not been submitted to a collector. This can be
either because the collector was unreachable when we attempted to
submit the report or because the policy of the collector did not
support the specified test.
