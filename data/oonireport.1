Display this help and exit.
.TP
.BR \-\^c " or " \-\-collector

be submitted to either the collector specified as an option (\-c) or to the
collector that was previously used.
If a report file is specified then only that report file will be uploaded
.TP
.BR status
Outputs all of the reports that are either "not uploaded", "incomplete" or
"pending".
The possible statuses are:

.BR not-created
.sp
If it has not been created, because the user specified to not use a
collector.

.BR creation-failed
.sp
If we attempted to create the report, but failed to do so either because
the collector does not accept our report or because it was unreachable at the
time.

.BR created
.sp
If the report has been successfully created, but has not yet been closed.

.BR incomplete
.sp
If the report has been created, but we have failed to update the report
with some data.

.SH OONIREPORT
.sp
This tool is used to upload reports that are stored on the users filesystem and
have not been submitted to a collector. This can be either because the
collector was unreachable when we attempted to submit the report or because the policy
of the collector did not support the specified test.
