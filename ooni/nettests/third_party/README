There is no license for NetalyzrCLI.jar; so while we include it, it's just
for ease of use.

We currently support interfacing with the ICSI Netalyzr system by wrapping
the NetalyzrCLI.jar client. It was downloaded on August 5th, 2011 from the
following URL:
  http://netalyzr.icsi.berkeley.edu/NetalyzrCLI.jar

More information about the client is available on the cli web page:
  http://netalyzr.icsi.berkeley.edu/cli.html

After looking at NetalyzrCLI.jar, I discovered that '-d' runs it in a
debugging mode that is quite useful for understanding their testing
framework as it runs.
