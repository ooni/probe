#  **************
#
#  The test reports censorship if the cardinality of the intersection of
#  the query result set from the control server and the query result set
#  from the experimental server is zero, which is to say, if the two sets
#  have no matching results whatsoever.
#
#  NOTE: This test frequently results in false positives due to GeoIP-based
#  load balancing on major global sites such as google, facebook, and
#  youtube, etc.
